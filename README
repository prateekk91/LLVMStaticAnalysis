Run the make llvm command as in Section 1 of the project here: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp14/cse231-a/proj1.html.
Ensure that the llvm environment as provided in the project is set up.

This folder contains the Data Analysis Framework, Lattice Points and Flow Functions for the various analysis

The folder has 3 scripts:
1. runConstantProp.sh
2. runCSE.sh
3. runRangeAnalysis.sh

The benchmarks are contained in the Benchmarks folder inside the current folder.

To run the above scripts on the provided benchmarks, please proceed as follows:

./run(*).sh "benchmarkName" (without quotes)
e.g, if you would like to run constant propagation on benchmark constantPropTest, the script it as follows:
./runConstantProp.sh constantPropTest

We run mem2reg on each benchmark before running the analysis. You may find the ll files before and after application of analysis and transformation in the Benchmarks folder.

E.g, on running the script above, the following files will be generated in the Benchmark folder:
-constantPropTest_mem2reg.ll
-constantPropTest_constantProp.ll
where the former is the output of mem2reg pass, and the latter is the output for constant propagation pass.

Similar is the case for Range Analysis and Common SubExpression Elimination pass.
The explanation of the output is given when the script is executed.

The description, speciality of each benchmark is provided in the banchmarks as comments.
